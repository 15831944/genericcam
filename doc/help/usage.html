<h1>
Workflow
</h1>

This chapter is an overview on the steps that can be taken to generate
the CAM paths from some objects generated by CAD and other programs. </div>
<h2>
Load 3D Objects
</h2>

The objects are transferred from the CAD software by the importers:

<ul>
<li>
STL
</li>
<li>
DXF
</li>
<li>
GTS
</li>

</ul>

STL is the most common format for exchanging geometry between programs. 

<h3>
Modify Objects
</h3>

After importing the objects can be transformed. There are small
operations like scaling, rotating, mirroring and moving. These
operations can always be applied to selected objects. </div>

Copy operations


Copy the selected object into an array of objects.


Slicing Objects


Some objects are to large to process in one run. By slicing an object,
several new objects are created. By slicing an big object down into
smaller objects in the size of the raw material, one can create a
layered version of the original setup. It is also possibe to create
objects that would not fint into the CNC machine available.

Mold Form Generation

Mold form generation is the generation of a
negative form of an object, that can be used later on to manufacture
the object itself. [B]  [B] read: "How to make chocolate Easter bunnies."

<h2>
Prepare Workpiece
</h2>

Setup the material the object is machined into. 


Caution:

The toolpath generator assumes that outside of the stock material is
empty, free space. If the stock material is to small in size, it may
happen that toolpath are generated, that approach the stock from the
side at high speeds. This may result in broken drills and mills.

<h3>
Select Stockpiece
</h3>

At first a piece of stock material is selected.

<h3>
Select Objects
</h3>
Selects which objects are milled in this piece of
material. Different parts of an object may be machined into dfferent
pieces of stock material. The selected parts are spread across the
stock material.

<h3>
Add Extra Objects
</h3>

Additional objects are special objects that can be used to generate last minute details.

For example this is used to add dowel holes into
the stock material and the machine bed. These features can later be
used to precisely position the stock when flipping over and machining
the back of an object.

Supports

To keep a workpiece from moving around freely, support structures are added to the workpiece.

Keepout Zones

Some areas in the stock material may not be
milled. For example the areas where there are screws in the machinebed
or where the clamps are that keep the stock on the machinebed.

<h2>
Define a Machine Run
</h2>
A machine run is one continuous run of a CNC
machine. During a run the machine may change tools, but the machine and
the workpiece are fixed.

<h3>
Load Machine Description
</h3>

Load a Lua file with a description of a CNC machine. 

<h3>
Define Tools
</h3>

Load or define tools in the toolbox. The toolbox allows for quickly accessing the right parameters for the different tools.


General Parameters


Shaft diameter and shaft length describe the part of an tool that disappears inside the chuck. 


Maximum speed is the max speed, the tool can handle before it suffers from a loss of structural integrity.


The feed coefficient fz is the amount of material a tooth of the tool can eat away per revolution.

<h3>
Select Workpiece
</h3>
Each run gets a workpiece assigned. A workpiece
can be assigned to different runs. in every run it can have a different
orientation, thus for example the top and bottom of an object can be
machined. In the second run, a workpiece starts of with the
modifications of the first run, thus hollowed out areas need not be
machined again.

<h3>
Toolpath Generators
</h3>
Toolpath are generated with many different
strategies. It may be feasible to use a different strategy on different
features of the same object.

Next to generating toolpath for a certain object,
it is also possible to simply load a toolpath and simulate it. An
existing toolpath can be loaded, simulated on some stock material.
Afterwards further toolpath can be generated that operate on the
already machined stock material.

<h2>
Simulation
</h2>
The simulator simulates the removal of material
as well as the motion of the machine. In the simulator problems can be
found before any real material is wasted.
