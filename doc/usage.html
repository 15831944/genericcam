<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-3">3</a> Workflow
</h1>
<div class="Standard">
This chapter is an overview on the steps that can be taken to generate the CAM paths from some objects generated by CAD and other programs. 
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.1">3.1</a> Load 3D Objects
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
The objects are transferred from the CAD software by the importers:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
STL
</li>
<li>
DXF
</li>
<li>
GTS
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Standard">
STL is the most common format for exchanging geometry between programs. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.1.1">3.1.1</a> Modify Objects
</h3>
<div class="Standard">
After importing the objects can be transformed. There are small operations like scaling, rotating, mirroring and moving. These operations can always be applied to selected objects. 
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-1"></a>Copy operations
</div>
<div class="Standard">
Copy the selected object into an array of objects.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-2"></a>Slicing Objects
</div>
<div class="Standard">
Some objects are to large to process in one run. By slicing an object, several new objects are created. By slicing an big object down into smaller objects in the size of the raw material, one can create a layered version of the original setup. It is also possibe to create objects that would not fint into the CNC machine available.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-3"></a>Mold Form Generation
</div>
<div class="Standard">
Mold form generation is the generation of a negative form of an object, that can be used later on to manufacture the object itself. <span class="FootOuter"><span class="SupFootMarker"> [B] </span><span class="HoverFoot"><span class="SupFootMarker"> [B] </span>read: "How to make chocolate Easter bunnies."</span></span>
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.2">3.2</a> Prepare Workpiece
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
Setup the material the object is machined into. 
</div>
<div class="Standard">
Caution:
</div>
<div class="Standard">
<div class="center">
<div class="Doublebox" style="width: 80%;">
The toolpath generator assumes that outside of the stock material is empty, free space. If the stock material is to small in size, it may happen that toolpath are generated, that approach the stock from the side at high speeds. This may result in broken drills and mills.
</div>

</div>

</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.2.1">3.2.1</a> Select Stockpiece
</h3>
<div class="Standard">
At first a piece of stock material is selected.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.2.2">3.2.2</a> Select Objects
</h3>
<div class="Standard">
Selects which objects are milled in this piece of material. Different parts of an object may be machined into dfferent pieces of stock material. The selected parts are spread across the stock material.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.2.3">3.2.3</a> Add Extra Objects
</h3>
<div class="Standard">
Additional objects are special objects that can be used to generate last minute details.
</div>
<div class="tableard">
For example this is used to add dowel holes into the stock material and the machine bed. These features can later be used to precisely position the stock when flipping over and machining the back of an object.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-4"></a>Supports
</div>
<div class="Standard">
To keep a workpiece from moving around freely, support structures are added to the workpiece.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-5"></a>Keepout Zones
</div>
<div class="Standard">
Some areas in the stock material may not be milled. For example the areas where there are screws in the machinebed or where the clamps are that keep the stock on the machinebed.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.3">3.3</a> Define a Machine Run
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
A machine run is one continuous run of a CNC machine. During a run the machine may change tools, but the machine and the workpiece are fixed.

</h3>
<div class="Standard">
Each run gets a workpiece assigned. A workpiece can be assigned to different runs. in every run it can have a different orientation, thus for example the top and bottom of an object can be machined. In the second run, a workpiece starts of with the modifications of the first run, thus hollowed out areas need not be machined again.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.3.4">3.3.4</a> Toolpath Generators
</h3>
<div class="Standard">
Toolpath are generated with many different strategies. It may be feasible to use a different strategy on different features of the same object.
</div>
<div class="Standard">
Next to generating toolpath for a certain object, it is also possible to simply load a toolpath and simulate it. An existing toolpath can be loaded, simulated on some stock material. Afterwards further toolpath can be generated that operate on the already machined stock material.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.4">3.4</a> Simulation
</h2>
<div class="Standard">
The simulator simulates the removal of material as well as the motion of the machine. In the simulator problems can be found before any real material is wasted.
