\section{Introduction}

Generic CAM is an open source tool path generator for CNC machines.


The "Generic" in Generic CAM stands for being universal. i.e. every
type of CNC machine can be targeted (Multi axis: X, Y, Z, A, B, C,
U, V, W).


Generic CAM starts from CAD data provided in STL or GTS file format.
Based on the capabilities of the selected CNC-machine G-codes are
generated.
